## Welcome to STAT 456 ðŸ‘‹

Head over to the [course website](https://stat456-s23.github.io) to learn more about the course!

We will try to use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/stat456-s23/discussions) for course communication, but will switch over to Campuswire if needed.

## Repo setup

After downloading GitHub Desktop, clone the [*stat456-content*](https://github.com/stat456-s23/stat456-content) repo to your computer. Content will be uploaded prior to class each morning and handouts will be printed for you (unless you prefer to annotate with a tablet).

Please additionally create a private repository within this organization named after you (e.g., *brittney-bailey*) for submitting your assignments (you can relabel the folder on your personal computer after you clone it).
